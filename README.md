CONFIGURATION AND FEATURES
--------------------------

Drupal core (what you get when you download and extract a drupal-x.y.tar.gz or
drupal-x.y.zip file from https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal) has what you
need to get started with your website. It includes several modules (extensions
that add functionality) for common website features, such as managing content,
user accounts, image uploading, and search. Core comes with many options that
allow site-specific configuration. In addition to the core modules, there are
thousands of contributed modules (for functionality not included with Drupal
core) available for download.

## Modules Used

1. Search Api
2. Telephone
3. AddToAny
4. AdminToolbar
5. Webform
6. FlexSlider
7. Pathauto


### Search Api

Search api module provides a framework for easily creating searches on any entity known to Drupal, using any kind of search engine. 
Especially for site administrators, it is a great alternative to other search solutions, since it already has good support and the ability to use the Views module for displaying search results, filters, etc. 

It already comes with Apache Solr integration, a high-performance search engine.


### Telephone

Telephone module inside of the Drupal 8 core is a future-proof alternative to the Phone module. It adds the functionality of input of full formats of contact numbers.


### AddToAny

AddToAny module adds the share buttons for Drupal including AddToAny's universal sharing button, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Reddit, SMS, email and many more.

The module also includes vector share buttons and use AddToAny SVG icons. AddToAny vector icons load efficiently, are mathematically precise, scalable to any size, and stunning on High-PPI screens such as Retina and Retina HD displays.


### AdminToolbar

The Admin Toolbar module is uded to improve the default Toolbar (the administration menu at the top of your site) to transform it into a drop-down menu, providing a fast access to all administration pages.

The module works on the top of the default toolbar core module and is therefore a light module and keeps all the toolbar functionalities (shortcut / media responsive).


### Webform

The Webform module is used to build any type of form to collect any type of data, which can be submitted to any application or system. 
Each behavior and aspect of your forms and their inputs are customizable. 
Whether you need a multi-page form containing a multi-column input layout with conditional logic or a simple contact form that pushes data to a SalesForce/CRM, it is all possible using the Webform module for Drupal 8/9.


### Flexslider

Flex Slider module integrates the Flex Slider library with Drupal and several contributed modules which allows us to build responsive, resizable slideshows. 
The slideshows automatically adapt to the size of the browser window or device.


### Pathauto

The Pathauto module automatically generates URL/path aliases for various kinds of content (nodes, taxonomy terms, users) without requiring the user to manually specify the path alias. 
This allows you to have URL aliases like /category/my-node-title instead of /node/123. 
The aliases are based upon a "pattern" system that uses tokens which the administrator can change.



## Use Cases

1. U can search for Hospitals using Names , Location and Speciality.
2. Can be used in case of Emergency for finding Nearby Hospitals.
